# Surveys

Hello, Comp users!
Welcome to your new Survey App.

* Use API to do basic CRUD operations on entities : Survey, Questions, Options, Users etc.
* Explore new Surveys in the survey collection.
* Submit the Survey at your will. Many times, multiple times - no bars.
* This is initial POC only and is not a full fledged product.

To make this product go high in quality, we would need the following things implemented :
* Proper user authorization and authentication system
* JWT based react app authentication
* Create more layers in the client app, namely - data modeling, service layers, secure routing etc.
* Replace SQLLite with something worthy of load handling - RDS, Azure SQL etc
* Based on the project structure, a doc7ument DB would make a good choice as well - CosmosDB anyone ?

We are using a fixed user (well, fixed User ID) for this POC.
